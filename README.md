## nexter

A realtor agency landing page. This project was built as a part of Jonas Schmedtmann's "Advanced CSS and Sass" course. See the final result: https://chipa014-nexter.netlify.app/

### Notes

This time my architecture was not too far off from what was suggested in the course, separated by components. I tried my best to adhere the React principles of small reusable components while also keeping it intuitive.

Using CSS variables in conjunction with Sass has proven a bit cumbersome since there's no full integration as of yet. Sometimes I had to duplicate variables with Sass just so I can use them. Waiting for a patch, I guess.

I thought I loved Flexbox. Then I met Grid.
They say that parenting changes how you see love, that you love your child like you've never loved anything nor anyone before. That's how I feel about Grid.

The BEM notation is deliberately ignored (except one place where it felt appropriate). Turns out it's not really necessary when your components have 3-5 different classes each.

There's definitely space for improvement. This website could be made interactive with the power of React, which I'm deliberately ignoring. I feel I'm going to be facing similar challenges in my upcoming pet project. As of now, I'm happy with where it ended up as an exercise and I'm excited to learn the next thing.
